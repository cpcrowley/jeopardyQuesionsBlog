<p><b>Data source</b>
The data used here are taken from the excellent Jeopardy site
<a href="http://j-archive.com/">J! Archive</a>.
You are encouraged to go look through that site.
Without J! Archive, this site would not exist.
They do the heavy listing of recording all the details of each Jeopardy game.
I can't thank them enough for their diligent work.
</p>

<p><b>Missing data</b>
J! Archive has records for all 33 seasons fo the Alex Trebeck era of Jeopardy!
This includes 230 games per season for seasons 20-32 (2003-2016),
228-230 games each for seasons (14-19) (1997-2003)
and 198 games for season 13 (1996-1997)
For the early seasons they have:
1: 38 games, 2: 43 games, 3: 78 games, 4: 120 games, 5: 70 games,
6: 151 games, 7: 51 games, 8: 47 games, 9: 63 games, 10: 49 games,
11: 39 games, and 12: 76 games.
So this data is a bit spotty.
In addition, 123 of these games are missing both rounds and 10 are missing <thead>
second (Double Jeopardy round).
But this still leaves over 5000 Jeopardy games to do statistics over.
</p>

<p><b>Technical details</b>
I collected the data by scraping the HTML from j-archive and converting it to
a JSON file which the server reads in and uses to create the tables.
Everything is written in JavaScript.
Several node.js programs are used to collect and summarize the data.
The code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/cpcrowley/jeopardyQuestions">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Extracting the data from the scaped HTML depends on the source site, that is,
J! Archive, being consistent in how it encodes each game.
Luckily they are very consistent and the extaction was not too hard.
There are a few places where it was a little difficult to isolate the data I
needed because there weren't enough distictive patterns around the data.
