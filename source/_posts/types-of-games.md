The core of Jeopardy are the regular, daily games consisting of the returning champion, the winner of the previous day, and two new challengers. I call these *regular* games.

Every year they have a two-week tournament with the top 15 players from the previous season. From time to time they have other tournaments in the same format: two weeks, 15 players, down to 9 after the first week, and down to three for the a two-game final on Thursday and Friday to determine the winner. I call these *tournament* games.

Occasionally they have celebrity tournaments where well-known people players against each other. This includes an annual "Power Players" week where they have people from Washington. I call all these *celebrity* games.

Finally each year they have various school-related games. This includes college students, high-school students, teachers and sometime younger students. I call these *school* games

The purpose of this classification is to compare how the various groups do. You can separate out the statistics for the four types of games in the "Players", "Number of Games" and "Final Jeopardy" tabs.
