How often does the leader win in Final Jeopardy? How much harder do the questions get as you go down the rows? Are Daily Doubles harder than other questions? How often did Ken Jennings have a lockout going into Final Jeopardy?
[This site](/jeopardy) will answer those questions and many, many more. The [previous version](/jeopardyApp) might be a little faster since it is a single-page web app.
