**It is hard to win on Jeopardy** Only 28% of contestants make it past the first game. Out of about 10,000 players, less than 3,000 win any games at all.

**The champion wins 44% of the time** Almost 72% of players lose in their first games so there is a 28% chance of a challenger (a non-champion) winning a game. There are two challengers so they have a 56% of winning. This means the champion has a 44% chance of winning.
