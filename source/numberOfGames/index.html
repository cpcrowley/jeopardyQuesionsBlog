  <header class="archive-article-title">
    The champion wins 44% of the time</header>
  Almost 72% of players lose in their first games so there is a 28% chance of a challenger (a non-champion) winning a game. There are two challengers so they have a 56% of winning. This means the champion has a 44% chance of winning.
