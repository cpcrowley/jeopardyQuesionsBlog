    <div class="observations-body">
      <ul>
        <li><span class="observation-title">The leader usually wins.</span><br/> The dollar leader going into final jeopardy wins 74% of the time, 65% if there is not a lock. The player in third only has an 8% chance of winning even if there is not a
          lock.
        </li>
        <li><span class="observation-title">Locks.</span><br/> Sometimes the leaer has a <em>lock</em>, that is, more than twice as much money as the second place player, so a low bet will guarantee a win no matter how final jeopardy comes out. The leader
          has a lock 27% of the time.
        </li>
        <li><span class="observation-title">Brad Rutter.</span><br/> Brad Rutter played in the era when you could only play five regular games and then you had to quit. He has since played in 23 tournament games an done very well, with 7 locks in those
          23 games, against tournament quality players.
