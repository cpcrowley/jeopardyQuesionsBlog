<p><b>Quick Start</b>
Choose a topic from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.
</p>

<p><b>Why this site?</b>
I created this site because I had questions about Jeopardy.
</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>
Each topic page ends with some notes and observations about the data.
</p>

<p><b>Data source</b>
The data used here are taken from the excellent Jeopardy site
<a href="http://j-archive.com/">J! Archive</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Additions and corrections</b>
If there are any statistics you want the site to compute send me an
<a href="mailto:cpcrowley@gmail.com">email</a> and I will try to add it.
</p>

<p><b>Technical details</b>
I collected the data by scraping the HTML from j-archive and converting it to
a JSON file which the server reads in and uses to create the tables.
Everything is written in JavaScript.
Several node.js programs are used to collect and summarize the data.
The code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/cpcrowley/jeopardyQuestions">here</a>.
