            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title">Ken Jennings.</span><br/> His percent answered right is high but not the highest. Where he shines is the number of clues he answers per game where he is way above everybody else with 36.2 clues per game with
                the next best person is at 30.0 clues per game. That is 20% more clues per game.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title">Daily Doubles.</span><br/> Players who win a lot of games answer a lot of daily doubles. Some of this is the strategy of "hunting" for daily doubles and part of it is that multiple-game winners just answer a
                lot of questions correctly. A few people also seem to bet big on daily doubles.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title">Daily Double Bets.</span><br/> Roger Craig is the highest bettor. He win an aaverage of $9213 on 1.8 daily double per game, an average of over $5118 per daily double. Matt Jackson is close with an average of
                $8194 on 1.9 daily doubles per game, with an average daily double win of $4312
