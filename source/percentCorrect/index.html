        <ul>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">Questions do get harder as you go down the rows.</span><br/> You can see this by the % correct in each row, from 93% in row 1 to 69% in row 5. And row 5 is a lot harder, 69% versus 78% for row 4.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">The double jeopardy round is harder than Jeopardy round.</span><br/> Especially in rows 3, 4 and 5. Row 5 is a full 10% harder.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">Daily double questions are harder than regular questions in the same row.</span><br/> Especially in the second row where the percent correct is 23% lower.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">Daily double questions are all hard.</span><br/> They are about the same hardness is rows 2, 3 and 4. Row 5 is very hard with only 57% correct.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">The question difficulty has stayed roughly the same over the seasons.</span><br/> Although the questions in seasons 7-13 were a little easier.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">People do better in tournament games.</span><br/> This makes sense since the players in the tournament games are the big winners from the regular games.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">Most of the tournament advantage comes in double jeopardy.</span><br/> Almost all, in fact.
            </li>
            <li><span class="observation-title ">Out-of-order clues.</span><br/>
                <p>Usually players select clues from the top down, starting with the lowest dollar values. Sometines players choose a clue out of order, that is, before all the clues above it have been chosen. One reason to do this is to hunt for the daily
                    doubles. Another reason is a accumulate money quickly or to catch opponents off-guard.</p>

                <p>You can see that the percent correct goes down a little bit for out-of-order clues probably due to people not fully understanding how the category works. But the effect is faily small.</p>

                <p>The percent of clues that are out-of-order was high in the first 6-7 seasons and then went down for 20 seasons. Starting in season 27 it started going up again. This is probably due to more sophisticated player strategies, mainly hunting
                    for daily doubles.</p>
